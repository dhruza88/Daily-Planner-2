# Daily-Planner

Note: I had to create a new repo for this as no matter what i did the last update to my style sheet was not taking any effect. I had over 10 commits in the original repo, so that is why there is so few in this one. Thank you

In Module 5 we were tasked to develop the javascript code to create the daily planner based off the built html and css files.

Throughout this process i learned how truly dependent a script can be based off arrays.

This activity forced us to have to be able to manipulate attributes of arrays to display the proper time in sequential clock order. Rather than trying to order based off integer value.

The moment function was necesary to be able to show the current Date and Time in the header of the screen.

Also while using the new Date method to store the current hours to color code the schedule depending on time of day.

Multiple If and ForEach loops were used to check against certain conditions to display the proper output. Whether it was converting from military time to standard time, determining am or pm. Also in tie with the highlighting feature for comparing the blocks to the current time of day.

Using a grid system i was able to dynamically develop rows and columns to display the schedule as portrayed in the project guidelines.
